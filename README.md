# 🌊 Wavelet ↔ Sleep-PRS & LDSC Visualizer

An interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore associations between wavelet-derived ECG features, sleep-related PRS (polygenic risk scores), and genetic correlations (LDSC).

This app integrates multiple statistical analyses and visual tools to help interpret the relationship between genetic data and ECG wavelet phenotypes.
